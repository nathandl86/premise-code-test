<h1>Duty Hours App Overview</h1>
<p>This is an application to track duty hours for Residents at medical institutions to 
ensure compliance with ACGME rules.</p>
<h3>Building Process</h3>
<p>I've begun the process of building this application. The steps I'm breaking it down
into are going to be as follows:</p>
<h4>Initial Steps</h4>
<ol>
<li>
Scaffolding the app's solution. This includes:
<ul>
<li>Setup of projects I know will be needed</li>
<li>Pulling in Nuget packages that will be used</li>
<li>Adding client libraries</li>
<li>Stubbing out the setup of Autofac for IoC</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Designing the backend data model to support the application</li>
<li>Define and build the data layer code</li>
<li>Define and stub the API interactions</li>
<li>
From this point the application should be setup nicely so that remaining modules
of work should largely be capable of being worked independently and in parallel. 
Those other pieces/modules are: 
<ul>
<li>
Building rules engine to process during analysis of Resident duty hours to 
ensure compliance.
</li>
<li>Building UI component for Resident calendar</li>
<li>Building UI component for Resident time/shift entry</li>
<li>
Building UI component for admin users to be able to run analysis for 1 -&gt; many<br />
Residents
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Upon completion of the first set of modules:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Build UI component to output analysis details to admins and Residents</li>
<li>
Integration of the resident calendar module into the analysis page to 
    show details on broken compliance rules
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>Refactor away from built-in ASP.NET bundling and mification to gulp</li>
<li>
Add authentication and authorization rules to application to ensure:
<ul>
<li>Resident's who aren't also Admins, cannot run analysis on any other Residents</li>
<li>Admins's who aren't residents, cannot enter time/shifts</li>
<li>Web Apis needing authorization or decorated with <code>[Authorize]</code> attribute</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
